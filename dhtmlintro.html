	<h1>Introduction to DHTML</h1>
	<p>
		DHTML stands for Dynamic Html, it is different from HTML.It is based on the properties of HTML, Java scripts,CSS and DOM.<br><br>
		It is used to create interactive and animated webpages in real time, they are also known as dynamic webpages.Like HtML DHTML is not a language.It is an interface or browsers enhancement feature.<br><br>
		Very excited to try the dynamic webpages!!!
